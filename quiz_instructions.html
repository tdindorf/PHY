<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>
When answering quiz questions, keep in mind the following:
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>You can <b>CHECK</b> your answer to see if it is correct. If 'correct': good, you scored a point! If 'incorrect' - you lose 20% of the question's value (e.g. 0.2 of a 1 point question), so think twice before you hit CHECK! Still, you have 5 chances to answer a question correctly, and score at least some points...
</li>
<li>
You can go to the <b>NEXT</b> question if you'd rather work on something different.
The one you were working on remains 'open' i.e. not submitted for marking yet, so you can return to it later.  Any answer you entered so far is remembered by the system.
</li>
<li>
If you need a longer break, you can navigate away from the quiz; again, the answers you entered so far will be saved.  When you return, a button <b>CONTIUNE LAST ATTEMPT</b> will be visible.
</li><li>
Once you <b>SUBMIT all and FINISH</b>, you'll get feedback with your score, and a record of all of your answers.
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
You can <b>retake</b> the quiz any time you like (click on <b>New Attempt</b>), and as many times as you like, to improve your result. 
Each time you do so, however, the questions will change, so <b>learn how to solve problems</b> - memorizing answers is pointless.
</p>
<p>
Your aim should be to <b>consistently</b> achieve an overall score of least 90% on <b>repeated</b> retakes: even if you get over 90% on your first (or nth) attempt, take the quiz again and again until no question surprises you. I expect to see you <b>logged on and testing yourself</b> (on this, or any quiz(es) of your choice) <b>for 15-20 min each and every week</b>, from now till the end of the course.
</p>
<p>
Have fun: your preparation, and revision, for the final exam starts here!
